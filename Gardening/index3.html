    <h1>Interests - Seasonal/Annual</h1>
    <p>Seasonal plants thrive at specific times of the year,<br> like tulips in spring and sunflowers in summer,
        <br>while annuals
        complete their life cycle in one growing season,<br> such as marigolds and petunias. Combining both can create
        <br> vibrant,
        varied gardens that change with the <br>seasons, providing continuous interest and color.</p>
    <h1>Garden size needed</h1>
    <p>The size of your garden depends on the types of <br> plants you want to grow and your gardening goals. For a <br>
        small herb or
        flower garden, a space of 10-20 square feet <br>may suffice, while larger vegetable or fruit gardens typically
        <br>require at
        least 100 square feet. Consider your <br>available space, time for maintenance, and how much produce or
        <br>flowers you wish to
        harvest.</p>
