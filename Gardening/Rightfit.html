    <h1>Interests - Seasonal/Annual</h1>
    <p>Seasonal plants thrive at specific times of the year, like tulips in spring and sunflowers in summer,
        while annuals
        complete their life cycle in one growing season, such as marigolds and petunias.<br> Combining both can create
         vibrant,
        varied gardens that change with the seasons, providing continuous interest and color.</p>
    <h1>Garden size needed</h1>
    <p>The size of your garden depends on the types of  plants you want to grow and your gardening goals. <br> a 
        small herb or
        flower garden, a space of 10-20 square feet may suffice, while larger vegetable or fruit gardens typically
        require at
        least 100 square feet. Consider your available space, time for maintenance, and how much produce or
        flowers you wish to
        harvest.</p>
