    <H1>Watering Amounts</H1>
    <p>Watering needs for plants vary widely depending on type. <b>Succulents and cacti</b> need minimal water, about
        once every 2-3
        weeks, allowing soil to dry completely between waterings. Medium-water plants like <b>snake plants </b> should
        be
        watered every 1-2 weeks, letting the top inch of soil dry out. High-water <b>tropical plants</b> such as
        <b>ferns and peace lilies</b>
        require weekly watering, with the soil kept consistently moist but not waterlogged. For <b>vegetables</b>,
        <b>leafy greens</b> need
        regular moisture, <b>while root vegetables prefer deeper, less frequent watering.Trees and shrubs</b>,
        <i>especially</i> <b>young ones</b>,
        need deep watering every 7-10 days, while <b>mature trees can be watered monthly during dry periods.</b> Always
        adjust based on
        factors like <b>soil, climate, and growth stage</b>.</p>

    <h1>Climates</h1>
    <p>Different climates affect watering needs significantly. In <b>hot, dry climates,</b> plants need more
        <b>frequent, deep watering</b>
        due to rapid evaporation, while in <b>humid climates,less watering</b> is required since the air retains
        moisture. In <b>cool or
            temperate climates, plants need moderate watering with slower evaporation rates,</b> and in <b>tropical
            climates, consistent
            but not excessive watering is key due to high humidity.</b> Always adjust based on local rainfall and
        temperature.</p>

    <h1>Plant food/Fertilizer</h1>
    <p>Plant food, or fertilizer, comes in three main types: <mark>organic</mark> (like compost), <mark>synthetic
        </mark>(chemical-based), and
        <mark>slow-release.</mark> Organic fertilizers <b>enhance soil health and provide nutrients gradually,</b> while
        synthetic options <b>deliver
            quick results.Timing</b> is crucial; fertilize during the <b>growing season</b> (spring and summer)
        according to plant needs,
        ensuring <b>not to over-fertilize, which can harm plants.</b>

    <h1>How to protect from Bugs</h1>
    <p>To protect plants from bugs, regularly inspect them for signs of infestation and remove any affected leaves or
        pests by
        hand. Use organic insecticidal soaps or neem oil as natural repellents, and consider introducing beneficial
        insects like
        ladybugs. Maintaining healthy soil and proper watering can also boost plant resilience, making them less
        attractive to
        pests. Additionally, planting companion plants can deter harmful insects.</p>
